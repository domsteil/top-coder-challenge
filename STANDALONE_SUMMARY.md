# Standalone Solutions Summary

## Performance Comparison

| Solution | Score | MAE | Description |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------|
| **RandomForest (Self-Contained)** | **5378** | **$52.78** | Best overall - Pure Python RF with 100 trees |
| Original Optimized Standalone | 11719 | $117.19 | Decision tree with basic corrections |
| Final Standalone | 11745 | $116.45 | Decision tree with conservative RF insights |
| Balanced Standalone | 11787 | $117.87 | Decision tree with balanced RF insights |
| Improved Standalone | 13710 | $137.10 | Decision tree with aggressive RF features |
| Ultra-Optimized | 15508 | $155.08 | Decision tree with 12 layers of corrections |
| Ultimate Competition | 29615 | $296.15 | Ensemble approach - performed poorly |

## Key Findings

1. **The RandomForest solution is by far the best** with a score of 5378 (MAE $52.78)
2. All attempts to improve the decision tree with RF insights made it worse
3. The more complex the corrections, the worse the performance
4. Ensemble approaches don't work well without proper training

## Best Standalone Solution: `run.sh`

The current `run.sh` contains the self-contained RandomForest solution which:
- Has no external dependencies (pure Python)
- Achieves score of 5378 (MAE $52.78)
- Uses 38 engineered features
- Contains 100 decision trees converted to Python code
- Applies minimal post-processing (only +$5.01 for .49/.99 endings)

## Why Decision Tree Approaches Failed

1. **Oversimplification**: Decision trees can't capture the complex non-linear relationships
2. **Correction Mismatch**: RF insights don't translate well to simpler models
3. **Feature Interactions**: The 38 RF features have complex interactions that simple rules can't replicate
4. **Overfitting**: Aggressive corrections based on specific cases led to poor generalization

## Recommendation

Use the self-contained RandomForest solution (`run.sh`) for submission. It's:
- Truly standalone (no sklearn or external dependencies)
- Best performing by a large margin
- Stable and well-tested
- Ready for production use
